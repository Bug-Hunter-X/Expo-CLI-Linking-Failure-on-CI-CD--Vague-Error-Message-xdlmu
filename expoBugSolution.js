The root cause of the vague 'Linking failed' error turned out to be related to the environment variables and permissions within the CI/CD pipeline.  Even though the local environment had all the necessary dependencies,  GitHub Actions lacked proper access or configuration. 

**Solution:**

1. **Detailed Logging:**  Add more verbose logging to the Expo CLI build process to capture more information about the linking phase. You can achieve this by using environment variables that impact logging levels.
2. **Environment Variables:**  Explicitly define and verify that all necessary environment variables (e.g., `ANDROID_HOME`, `JAVA_HOME`) are correctly set within the CI/CD environment. Use commands such as `echo $ANDROID_HOME` to check the values. Ensure the correct permissions for the required variables.
3. **Android SDK Configuration:**  Double-check that the Android SDK, build-tools, and other necessary components are correctly installed and accessible within the CI/CD environment. Consider adding steps to the CI/CD script that explicitly check for the required components and report errors if they are missing.
4. **Permissions:** Ensure the CI/CD pipeline has sufficient permissions to access required directories (e.g., Android SDK location) and execute necessary commands. 
5. **Clean Build:** Sometimes a clean build can resolve unexpected issues. Try adding commands to the CI/CD script that clean the build directories before starting a new build. 
6. **Debugging via ADB:** On Android, use the Android Debug Bridge (adb) to get more insights into the linking process. It might expose more details about the failure.

**Example (adding detailed logging in package.json):**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "expo start --log-level verbose",
    "android": "expo build:android --log-level verbose"
  }
}
```
