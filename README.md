# Expo CLI Linking Failure on CI/CD

This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug encountered while using Expo CLI for building a React Native project. The issue manifests only during continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), specifically on GitHub Actions. Locally, the project builds without any problems, but the CI/CD pipeline fails with a generic 'Linking failed' error. No detailed error messages provide clues to pinpoint the root cause.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to build the project using Expo CLI on your local machine (should succeed).
3. Attempt to build the project using Expo CLI within a CI/CD environment (e.g., GitHub Actions) (should fail). 

## Solution
The solution content details how to debug further into the process, and offers some potential solutions for debugging. This may involve more detailed logging and analyzing the underlying linking processes, potentially using the Android Debug Bridge (adb) or similar tools.
